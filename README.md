# 🏆 Blind-Auction-Program

**Level: Beginner+**  
A Python-based blind auction tool where users enter their name and a secret bid.  
The program stores all bids in a dictionary, compares them, and announces the highest bidder.  
This project practices loops, dictionaries, input handling, and comparison logic —  
making it an excellent beginner+ exercise for working with dynamic user data.

## 📝 Description
This project simulates a blind auction where multiple participants submit hidden bids.  
The program collects each bidder's name and their bid amount, storing the data in a dictionary.  
After all bids are collected, the program determines the highest bidder and displays the winner.

Users can choose to continue adding bidders until all participants have entered their bids.
